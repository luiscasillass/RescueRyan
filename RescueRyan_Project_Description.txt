# RescueRyan - Project Overview

## Introduction
RescueRyan is a text-based strategy game developed in Python, where the player takes on the role of a soldier on a critical mission. The objective is to guide Corporal Ryan through a labyrinth filled with dangers, ensuring his safe escape from enemy-infested territory. The game combines elements of strategy, quick thinking, and a bit of luck, creating an engaging and challenging experience for players.

## Storyline
The game is set during a fictional World War II scenario. Corporal Ryan, a brave soldier, finds himself trapped behind enemy lines in a Nazi-occupied zone. The player, acting as Ryan’s commander, must navigate him through a maze-like battlefield filled with hostile forces. The mission is clear: evade or confront enemies, find the safest path, and lead Ryan to safety. If Ryan fails to escape, he is considered fallen in combat.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Dynamic Board Rendering:** The game employs dynamic board rendering, making the movement of Ryan and the enemies appear fluid. This enhances the immersion and gives a real-time feel to the gameplay.
- **Maze Navigation:** The game’s core challenge lies in navigating the maze. Each move must be carefully planned to avoid enemy encounters while seeking the quickest route to freedom.
- **Enemy Interaction:** Enemies patrol certain areas of the maze. Players must decide whether to evade or confront them, adding a layer of strategy to the game.
- **Random Elements:** Certain elements of the game are randomized, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique challenge.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Dependencies:** The game uses standard Python libraries, ensuring it can be run in most environments without additional installations.
- **Platform:** The game is designed to be played in a terminal or command-line interface, making it lightweight and accessible.
